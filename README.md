# did_multiplegt
Estimation in Difference-in-Difference (DID) designs with multiple groups and periods.

**Short description**

did_multiplegt estimates the effect of a treatment on an outcome, using group- (e.g. county- or state-) level panel data with multiple groups and periods. The panel of groups may be unbalanced: not all groups have to be observed at every period (see FAQ section for more info on that).  The data may also be at a more disaggregated level than the group level (e.g. individual-level wage data to measure the effect of a regional-level minimum-wage on individuals' wages). The treatment doesn't need to be binary.

**Installation**

Check out the command in stata for more details.

```applescript
ssc install did_multiplegt, replace
```
